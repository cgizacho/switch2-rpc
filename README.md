# switch2-rpc
A python tool that lets you locally display playing a Switch 2 Game. Uses a "fake game" exe to display the rpc.

## Disclaimer
This tool was made by me due to the Nintendo API being off-limits now, and no way to display when you're online (aside locally).
It's use is for you to have templates for Switch games, so you don't have to fill it out on some random local RPC tool.

## Usage
You can add your own files into the exe by editing the .py (and using it from there, or alternatively compiling it again yourself).
Please note that you will need to make your own [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) for each game and use that client ID to display the game's name.
